/* Problem 32
 * We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use
 * of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example,
 * the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
 * The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254,
 * containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
 * Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity
 * can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
 * HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way
 * so be sure to only include it once in your sum.
 * NOTE:
 * in the following formula: a * b = c
 * c will always be a four digit number and its either the product of
 *  - a one digit number and a four digit number
 *  - a two digit number and a three digit number
 * thus 1 <= a <= 98 and 123 <= b <= 9876
