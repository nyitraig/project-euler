# project-euler
This repository contains my solutions for the problems of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

The programs are written in `c++`, and can be executed from the command line to print out the solution.

## Makefile (Windows)

All solutions can be executed on the command line from the project-euler directory by using the command `makefile <files>` (defined in `makefile.bat`).

As an example:
> $ makefile 001\main.cpp
