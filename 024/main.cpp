/* Problem 24
 * A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects.
 * For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4.
 * If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically,
 * we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:
 * 012   021   102   120   201   210
 * What is the millionth lexicographic permutation
 * of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?
 * NOTE:
 * We can construct the next permutation in lexicographic order
 * by following these simple steps (as explained by Michal Fori≈°ek https://bit.ly/2toGEas):
 * 1. Find the largest x such that P[x]<P[x+1].
 *    (If there is no such x, P is the last permutation.)
 * 2. Find the largest y such that P[x]<P[y].
 * 3. Swap P[x] and P[y].
 * 4. Reverse P[x+1 .. n].
